# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.
# Overview of the Analysis
## Deliverable 3:
Although this project was a bit challenging for us. I was able to complete the analysis to the best of my knowledge. I was able to help Bobby's manager prepare for the Silver Tsunami. I can conclude that my analysis reflects on the retirees and when will they be retiring. Bobby was able to determine the number of retiring employees, which was our goal for the project. We were also able to determine which employees that are eligible to participate in the mentorship program.
